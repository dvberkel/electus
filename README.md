Electus allows you to agree/disagree with a statement in real time.

Setup
-----

Electus is setup as a [node module][1] and uses [grunt][2] to automate
various tasks. Run the following command to install all the
dependencies

    npm install

The next command runs the default grunt task

    ./node_modules/.bin/grunt

An other option is to add `<PROJECT_DIR>/node_modules/.bin/` to you
path and just execute `grunt`.
